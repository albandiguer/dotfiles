Using nix-darwin, home-manager, neovim and a few others tools

## Setup 
- Install [nix with installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) 
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
- Clone this repo and run `make` in it

## Neovim

### Languages 
- tree-sitter: syntax support for most languages
- cmp: completion plugin (tap into nvim-lsp, copilot, snippets engines etc.)
- nvim-lsp: support for language server protocol, install them individually
- null-ls: support for non-lsp tools to hook into the lsp client

  regular-lsp --> nvim-lsp
  nvim-lsp --> cmp
  copilot --> cmp
  luasnip --> cmp
  friendly-snippets --> luasnip
```

### Ruby

Why the current setup:

- `withRuby=false` so neovim does not create its own ruby environment, but rather use mise (local or global). Note that mason also comes with its own ruby env if needs
- `=true` would install a ruby in nix store, when installing stuff from wihin neovim it would try to write to that nix store location and fail
- in neovim type `:!gem env` to see whats exactly loaded. 
- However mise installed ruby does not ship with `neovim` gem out of the box, it needs to be installed on every new version. Luckily [mise]() comes with that option with a file `~/.default-gems`, see `mise.nix` and that file in `dotfiles/`


### exrc

Example, changing colorscheme and setting up a lsp natively bypassing mason
(ruby_lsp intalled in Gemfile or in ~/.default-gems).
```
# .nvim.lua
vim.cmd("colorscheme catppuccin")
require("lspconfig").ruby_lsp.setup({})
```

## Mise(-en-place)

[mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html)
use `mise ls` to list currently installed language

add shims directory to path so lsp etc are not lost
`mise activate --shims`


## Gist

`!h gist-vim` for help, tldr add a `~/.gist-vim` with `token xxx` in it, token
from gh with gist scope

### Reminders/mappings
Search + Replace all and save
> Telescope Grep to find the string project wise, CTRL+Q to add them all to the Quickfix list and then â€˜:cdo s/StringOne/StringTwo/g | updateâ€™

__Cmp__
```
ctrl+space -> complete
ctrl+b -> scroll docs up
ctrl+f -> scroll docs down
enter -> confirm
```

__LSP__
Default behaviour of Ctrl n comes from that, we overload it inside cmp settings

H -> Hover information
gt -> Type definition
gs -> Signature
gd -> Definition
gr -> References
ca -> Code action
```


## Tmux

### Keys

Select sessions named such as `<M-a>` in tmux sessions list selection.
We change the profile in iterm2 keys> keys config

```
Right option key : Esc+
```

## Fonts

[Github](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-9-patch-your-own-font)
Patch fonts for glyph like so
```
docker run --rm -v ~/dev/dotfiles/fonts/in:/in -v  ~/dev/dotfiles/fonts/out:/out nerdfonts/patcher
```

### Refacto happening

- Neovim config

#### Kickstart
- [x] Neotree ? included or byo
- [x] Mason lsp on a per project, currently it starts both ruby and solargraph :/
- [ ] Figure some mappings 
  - [x] Switch buffers leaderleader
  - [x] Open NeoTree
  - [x] Previous buffer
- [ ] ~~Added kickstarter as a submodule~~
```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/albandiguer/kickstart.nvim.git ./home/programs/kickstart-nvim/nvim/
```
=> although the idea is decent, in practice not good as for nix to work you need to check in changes in main git, related to derivation?
- [x] Markdown preview
